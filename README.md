- 👋 Hi, I'm @WojtekMs.  
I come from Poland and currently I am studying Cybersecurity at Wroclaw University of Science & Technology.  
I am eager to learn new things and cooperate with other people. I agree with Robert C. Martin, aka'Uncle Bob', about taking programming seriously and responsibly.  
I try to follow best practices and keep the code base clean.  
I find tests more and more helpful when building complex programs. If we can't be sure whether low-level things work, how can we build high-level things?

- 👀 I’m interested in:
  -  C++ 
  -  Best practices
  -  Clean Code
  -  Software Architecture
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  -  Design Patterns
  -  C++20
  -  Python
  -  Networking
  -  Security
  -  Computer Vision
  
- 💞️ I’m interested in participating in a group project.  
I'm looking for a fresh C++ open source project to contribute to.

- 📫 If you would like to contact me feel free to send me an e-mail: wojciech@matusiak.dev
